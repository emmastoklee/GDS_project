# Montreal In 15 Minutes

## Michel Poesze, Carolina Branas Soria, Emma Stoklund Lee

### Abstract

Urban planning and sustainability are essential in enhancing the liveability of cities, and the concept of
the 15-minute city offers a promising framework. This research focuses on Montreal, Canada, to evaluate its
adherence to the 15-minute city model, which aims to provide residents with access to essential amenities
within a 15-minute journey using various transportation methods. We developed an interactive app that
visually represents neighbourhood accessibility to different amenities via walking, cycling, and driving. Our
methodology involves collecting data from OpenStreetMap, processing it to create choropleth maps and
distance graphs, and presenting it through a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The app allows users
to analyse amenity distribution and travel times, aiding in informed relocation decisions and urban planning.
Our findings suggest that while Montreal shows potential as a 15-minute city, with some neighbourhoods like
Ville Marie and Le Plateau-Mont-Royal offering excellent amenity access, peripheral neighbourhoods need
improvements in accessibility. The research highlights the importance of reliable data and suggests future
enhancements, including integrating real-time data and public transportation analysis, to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of urban accessibility.
